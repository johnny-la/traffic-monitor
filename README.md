# Traffic Monitor

Monitors traffic from an Apache HTTP log.

## Improvements
To improve the application's design, I would do the following
- Add unit tests for all the methods and classes that perform key monitoring logic
- Implement a Linter to detect potential errors in the codebase, and identify code that is breaking code conventions.
